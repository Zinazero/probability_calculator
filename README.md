# A program that calculates the probability of an outcome based on experiments run by the code. Users can define the experiment by choosing how many of each colour ball is in the hat. They then choose the outcome they want to test for (expected_balls). Finally, they choose how many balls are drawn in each experiment and how many time the experiment is run. The program runs the experiment however many times the user chooses and calculates the probability based on how many times the expected outcome occurs. Because the experiments are run every time the program is run, the probability will vary slightly due to the finite number of experiments. This program was produced as part of the Scientific Computing with Python course on freeCodeCamp.org. Created by Jacob Hexamer.
